You can upgrade the version of EDB PgPool-II extensions, for example, from 4.2.5 to 4.2.6. 

For information about upgrading PgPool, see [Upgrading EDB Pgpool-II](../installing/upgrading).

!!! Note 
    4.3 is a major release. For more details on migrating from earlier versions to version 4.3, see [Migration](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/43/en/html/release-4-3-0.html#MIGRATION-4-3-0).

To upgrade PgPool-II extensions:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
```

Where:

-  `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system.

   | Package manager |         Operating system         |
   | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
   | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
   | zypper          | SLES                             |
   | apt-get         | Debian and Ubuntu                | 

- `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version, and `<yy>` is the EDB Pgpool-II extension version.

!!! Note
    Only minor version upgrade is supported. For example, you can upgrade from 3.6.20 to 3.6.21 extension but not to 3.7.14.
