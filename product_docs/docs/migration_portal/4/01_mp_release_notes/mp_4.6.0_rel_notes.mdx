|     Type     |                                                                                                            Description                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enhancement  | Improved performance of the schema parsing phase for large schema files that contain a large number of Oracle objects.                                                                                                            |
| Enhancement  | Migration Portal now supports assessing and migrating the `DEFAULT` profile.                                                                                                                                              |
| Enhancement  | A new repair handler (ERH-2104) was added that replaces `XMLTable` with `XMLParse` if the `XMLTable` call has a single argument.                                                                                             |
| Enhancement  | A new repair handler (ERH-2105) was added that puts parentheses around the value of the `IN` clause inside `SELECT` statements.                                                                                          |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the ERH-2030 repair handler issue where the NEW and OLD variable names updated in the `REFERENCING` clause by the repair handler weren't also updated in the `WHEN` clause of the trigger definition.           |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the ERH-2065 repair handler to remove the `INMEMORY` and `NO INMEMORY` clauses from the `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE` clause.                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the ERH-2002 repair handler issue where it wasn't being applied in some scenarios.                                                                                                                                         |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the ERH-2009 repair handler issue where it wasn't being applied in some scenarios.                                                                                                                                         |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the issue where the occurrence of the `UTL_HTTP.END_OF_BODY` exception inside PL/SQL objects wasn't handled in the parsing phase.                                                                                          |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the issue where `GRANT EXECUTE ON DIRECTORY` statements weren't getting removed from the uploaded source DDL scripts.                                                                                                      |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the issue where the `XMLRoot` function was incorrectly flagged as incompatible although it's supported in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.                                                                                    |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the issue where an assessment fails because of an `OutOfMemoryError` exception in some scenarios.                                                                                                                           |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed parsing issues related to the usage of the `REMARK`, `HOST` and `PROMPT` keywords in schema files.                                                                                                                          |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the issue where column names inside check constraints weren't double-quoted when the **Use Oracle's default case for schema migration** option was selected for the project.                                       |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Fixed the EDB DDL Extractor script so that it performs the permission check prior to performing the Oracle version check and actual schema extraction.                                                                           |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | Updated the DDL parser to comment out `GRANT RESOURCE` statements generated for roles without a schema.                                                                                                                           |

## End-of-support notice

EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 11 standard support is ending by November 20, 2023. Support for EDB Postgres Advanced Sever version 11 was removed from Migration Portal on May 20, 2023 to ensure that no new EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 11 projects were created after this date.

To maximize the length of available support and to take advantage of new features, particularly those that provide added compatibility with Oracle, we recommend selecting the latest EDB Postgres Advanced Server version as the target of a Migration Portal project. See the [EDB Platform Compatibility page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility) for more information on the support periods for each EDB Postgres Advanced Server major version.
