By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file for the RPM installer enforces `IDENT` authentication. Before invoking EDB\*Plus, you must either: 
- Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file, changing the authentication method to a form other than `IDENT` (and restarting the server.
- Ensure that an `IDENT` server is accessible. 

To ensure an `IDENT` server is accessible, you must confirm that an `identd` server is installed and running. You can use the `yum` package manager to install an `identd` server.

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install xinetd authd
    ```

-   On RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install xinetd authd
    ```

The command creates a file named `/etc/xinetd.d/auth` that contains:

```text
service auth
{
     disable = yes
     socket_type = stream
wait =no
user = ident
cps = 4096 10
instances = UNLIMITED
server = /usr/sbin/in.authd server_args = -t60 --xerror â€“os
}
```

!!! Note
    If the file includes a `-E` argument at the end of the server arguments, delete `-E`.

To start the `identd` server:

```text
systemctl enable xinetd
systemctl start xinetd
```

Open the `pg_ident.conf` file and create a user mapping:

```text
# map_name    system_username     postgres_username
  edbas         enterprisedb        enterprisedb
```

Where:

-   The name specified in the `map_name` column is a name you define to identify the mapping in the `pg_hba.conf` file.
-   The name specified in the `system_username` column is `enterprisedb`.
-   The name specified in the `postgres_username` column is `enterprisedb`.

Then, open the `pg_hba.conf` file and modify the `IDENT` entries:

-   If you're using an IPv4 local connection, modify the file entry to read:

     `host all all 127.0.0.0/0 ident map=edbas`

-   If you're using an IPv6 local connection, modify the file entry to read:

     `host all all ::1/128 ident map=edbas`

You must restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service before invoking EDB\*Plus. For detailed information about EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see the [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/) documentation.
