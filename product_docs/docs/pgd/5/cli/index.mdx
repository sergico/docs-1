The EDB Postgres Distributed Command Line Interface (PGD CLI) is a tool for managing your EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. It allows you to run commands against EDB Postgres Distributed clusters. It's installed automatically on systems in a TPA-deployed PGD cluster. Or it can be installed manually on systems that can connect to any PGD cluster, such as EDB BigAnimal distributed high-availability clusters or PGD clusters deployed using the EDB PGD for Kubernetes operator.

* [Installing PGD CLI](installing_cli) has instructions on manually installing PGD CLI on various systems.

* [Using PGD CLI](using_cli) offers an introduction to using the PGD CLI and how to connect to your PGD cluster.

* [Configuring PGD CLI](configuring_cli) has details on creating persistent configurations for quicker connections.

* [PGD CLI's Command reference](command_ref) covers all the available commands to inspect, manage, and get information about cluster resources.

* [Discovering connection strings](discover_connections) shows how to obtain the correct connection strings for your PGD-powered deployment.
