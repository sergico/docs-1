The EDB Job Scheduler extension offers these API functions: 

- `sys.reload_all_jobs` &mdash; Reloads all the unscheduled jobs from the current database. 

  !!! Note
     This function requests only the scheduler process. So, if the local storage of the scheduler limit meets the maximum set by `edb_job_scheduler.max_jobs_per_database`, loading fails. 

- `sys.dump_schedule()` &mdash; Displays the current job schedule from the scheduler's local memory. The scheduler's local memory dumps all the jobs that have yet to be executed into the server log in JSON format.
