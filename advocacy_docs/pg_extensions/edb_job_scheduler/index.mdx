EDB Job Scheduler is an extension that runs the job scheduler as a background process for the DBMS_SCHEDULER and the DBMS_JOB packages.

By default, the `edb_job_scheduler` extension resides in the `contrib/dbms_scheduler_ext` subdirectory under the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation.

The extension has a main background process called launcher. The launcher process starts when the database cluster loads. It forks the scheduler processes one for each configured database. The databases are configured by the GUC `edb_job_scheduler.database_list`.If a database doesn't have any jobs to be scheduled or done with all the schedules, the scheduler process shuts down after waiting for a minute. Whenever a new job is added or there is any update to the existing jobs in `sys.jobs`, the launcher process starts again.

It schedules the job only once based on the job run time. If the same job needs to be re-run then we need to feed the next job run time. All the recurring job scheduling is done through DBMS_SCHEDULER and DBMS_JOB package. If it is a recurring job then the next job run time is added by these packages and not by `edb_job_scheduler`.

`edb_job_scheduler` holds its meta-data in two tables under `sys` schema:

- `jobs` &mdash; holds information about the jobs to be run.
- `job_run_details` &mdash; holds information about the job status. The `status` can be `'r' - running`, `'s' - success`, or `'f' - failure` for the respective `jobid`.


The columns in the `sys.job` table:

```
   Column   |           Type
------------+--------------------------
 jobid      | bigint
 jobnextrun | timestamp with time zone
 jobcommand | text
 jobuser    | text
```

The columns in the `sys.job_run_details` table:

```
    Column    |           Type
--------------+--------------------------
 jobid        | bigint
 runid        | bigint
 username     | text
 workerpid    | integer
 status       | character(1)
 error        | text
 scheduletime | timestamp with time zone
 starttime    | timestamp with time zone
 endtime      | timestamp with time zone
```
